In this project I am creating a ping pong game. I built this design using html 5 canvas and flexBox to create a responsive website. 
In the javaScript file I'm creating a function for each part of the game,  then I'm calling those functions in a start game function that will run when the user clicks 
the screen. This approach allows me to keep my code more organized.
