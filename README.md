In this project I have created a pong game using VS Code ,html ,JavaScript and CSS. I was inspired to create a pong game beacuse it's a fun game and the rules are simple. My approach to this project was to create functions for each part of the game. I used the html 5 canvas API to create the table board and to draw all of the objetcs on screen such as the two rectangles and the ball. The left rectangle is player 1 and the right rectangle is player 2. After drawing all of the objects on screen I put them in a game loop and used the requestAnimationFrame(callback) method. This method causes the objects on screen to be constantly updated very quickly giving the illusion that the players and the ball are moving on the screen.

Technologies I used 

1. HTML

2. CSS 

3. JavaScript

4. HTML 5 Canvas
