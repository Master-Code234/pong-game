# Pong Game
In this project, I have created a classic Pong game using VS Code, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Pong is a fun game with simple rules, which inspired me to build this project.


## Approach taken

My approach to this project was to create separate functions for different aspects of the game. I utilized the HTML5 Canvas API to create the game board and render all the objects on the screen, such as the two paddles and the ball. The left paddle represents player 1, while the right paddle represents player 2. Once all the objects were drawn on the screen, I implemented a game loop to continuously update the game state.

## Technologies I used 

  - HTML

## How to play

1. To control player 1 use W for up and S for down

2. To control player 2 use A for up and D for down

3. Hit the ball into the enemy players goal to score a point

4. Protect your goal from the enemy player

5. The more you play the faster the ball moves

6. First player to reach 10 points wins the game
