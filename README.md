Approach taken

In this project I have created a pong game using VS Code ,html ,JavaScript and CSS. I was inspired to create a pong game beacuse it's a fun game and the rules are simple. My approach to this project was to create functions for each part of the game. I used the html 5 canvas API to create the table board and to draw all of the objetcs on screen such as the two rectangles and the ball. The left rectangle is player 1 and the right rectangle is player 2. After drawing all of the objects on screen I put them in a game loop.



Technologies I used 

1. HTML

2. CSS 

3. JavaScript

4. HTML 5 Canvas


How to play

1. To control player 1 use W for up and S for down

2. To control player 2 use A for up and D for down

3. Hit the ball into the enemy players goal to score a point

4. Protect your goal from the enemy player

5. The more you play the faster the ball moves

6. First player to reach 10 points wins the game
